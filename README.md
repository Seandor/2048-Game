# 2048

A clone of 2048 with a little variant.

Doing this mini-project for only two purposes, one is to practice more with the origin javascript, the other reason is that I could learn more about programming.

Develop note:

 - [X] add icon
 - [X] using canvas to draw the game board.
 - [X] null + null === 0
 - [ ] have to understand callback function 
 - [x] using Object to store key value pairs can do the same thing as the 'which' or 'if else' statement.
